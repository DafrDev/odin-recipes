    <h4>
      This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer
      the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great
      for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

      <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>⅚ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
      <li>⅙ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, divided, or to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>2⅔ ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>.17 egg</li>
      <li>.13 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps :</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over
        medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
        tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
        seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer,
        covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
        remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>

      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
        Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of
        mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with
        remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
        sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil
        does not touch the cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
        additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
